## Documentation

* The data used for these plots was taken as a subset prior to importing in R to help make the code a little cleaner and speed up processing.

* I used a shell script to subset the original data to 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02 which is saved as the file "subsetdata.txt". 

* The shell script is saved as "subset.sh"
